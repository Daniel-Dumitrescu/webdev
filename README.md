This GitHub repository consists of a sample of my web development projects, coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The Accounting and Finance Club website was created for the Accounting & Finance club at Colonel By Secondary School. 

The Accounting and Finance Club website version 2 is a project I initiated to redesign the existing website and build it using React. It is designed using Material UI components and a React Spring animation template. 

The 'Crocodile' game is a 2-player game created for elementary-school children during a Computer Studies course. The game is based on the concept of the game Snake with the design 
and additional features implemented as requested by the elementary-school children clients. The game can be played by navigating the green 'crocodile' with the arrow keys and 
the black 'pirate' with WASD keys. The goal is to try and capture the blue birdies while avoiding the enemy and any obstacles.

The Hangman game follows the rules of the traditional game of hangman, and can be played by opening HangmanSplash.html and using the on-screen navigation
